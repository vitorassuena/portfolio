                     In today's data-driven business landscape, understanding the key drivers behind a company's success is paramount. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) play a pivotal role in assessing the performance of an organization, enabling managers to make informed decisions and drive improvements. However, identifying the input metrics that significantly influence these KPIs can be a challenging task. This is where machine learning comes to the rescue.<br>Tools:

                  Identifying the most important KPIs within a Business Unit (BU) and the broader company can be a complex task. This project leverages machine learning models to establish the significance of various KPIs and prioritize them accordingly. By gaining a deeper understanding of these KPIs, stakeholders can make informed decisions and allocate resources more effectively.

                  <li><p class="text add-top-margin">Data Collection: Data related to various KPIs across the BU and company were collected, encompassing operational, financial, and customer-centric metrics. This comprehensive dataset served as the foundation for our analysis.</p></li>
                  <li><p class="text add-top-margin">Exploratory Data Analysis: An in-depth analysis of the dataset revealed insights into the relationships between input metrics and the KPI. Data distributions, correlations, and outliers were examined to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data.</p></li>
                  <li><p class="text add-top-margin">KPI Tree Analysis: A KPI tree was constructed, mapping the relationships between different KPIs. This hierarchical structure helped us visualize the dependencies and interactions among various metrics. By analyzing the tree, we gained insights into the KPIs that have the most significant impact on the overall performance of the BU and the company.</p></li>
                  <li><p class="text add-top-margin">Model Building and Evaluation: A robust machine learning pipeline was constructed using SKLearn and PyCaret libraries. Different algorithms were tested, optimized through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as the confusion matrix, AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score.</p></li>
                  <li><p class="text add-top-margin">Decision-Making and Resource Allocation: By identifying and prioritizing the most important KPIs, we gained a better understanding of the key drivers behind our BU and company success.
