               <p class="text">
                  Managing and monitoring corporate and business unit goals across different departments and teams can be a challenging task. Disparate systems and lack of visibility often hinder collaboration and alignment. Organizations face the problem of scattered Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) residing in various places such as Google Sheets, Jira, Looker, and Databases.
